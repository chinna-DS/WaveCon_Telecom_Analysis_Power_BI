## Problem Statement

AtliQo is one of the leading telecom providers in India and launched its 5G plans in May 2022 along with other telecom providers.

However, the management noticed a decline in their active users and revenue growth post the 5G launch in May 2022. AtliQo’s business director requested their analytics team to provide a comparison report of KPIs between the pre and post-periods of the 5G launch. The management is keen to compare the performance between these periods and gain insights that would enable them to make informed decisions to recover their active user rate and other key metrics. They also wonder if they can optimize their internet plans to attract more active users. Peter Pandey, a junior data analyst, is assigned to this task.

## Task

Imagine yourself as Peter Pandey and perform the following tasks:

1. Create the comparison report based on the mock-up provided. Note that the mock-up is created by a business user with minimal knowledge of dashboarding, so you need to represent the insights in a more effective way.
2. The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management; hence, the dashboard should be self-explanatory and easy to understand.
3. Create relevant insights not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard to support the cause.
