## Task

- Analyze the provided dashboard of our telecom client 'WaveCon'
- Create a presentation that clearly addresses the following critical questions:
1. What is the impact of the 5G launch on our revenue?
2. Which KPI is underperforming after the 5G launch?
3. After the 5G launch, which plans are performing well in terms of revenue? Which plans are not performing well?
4. Is there any plan affected largely by the 5G launch? Should we continue or discontinue that plan?
5. Is there any plan that is discontinued after the 5G launch? What is the reason for it?

## Key Insights

- **Revenue** has declined by 0.5% after implementing 5G.
- **Total Active Users (TAU)** is underperforming the KPI and has declined by 8.28%.
- **Plan P1** is performing well after the 5G implementation, with its revenue increasing by approximately 33%. Plans **P2 to P7** are not performing well, as their revenues have decreased when compared to 5G.
- **Plan P7** is largely affected by the 5G implementation because its revenue decreased by approximately 430 million.
- **P7 should be discontinued.** With the expansion of 5G, 3G becomes outdated, and customers prefer to use 4G and 5G.
