## Task

1. What is the impact of the 5G launch on our revenue?
2. Which KPI is underperforming after the 5G launch?
3. After the 5G launch, which plans are performing well in terms of revenue? Which plans are not performing well?
4. Is there any plan affected largely by the 5G launch? Should we continue or discontinue that plan?
5. Is there any plan that is discontinued after the 5G launch? What is the reason for it?
